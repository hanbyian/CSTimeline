            <p>After challenging my CS teacher in high school junior year to a coding competion to make a 2D game I got the idea to make a small castle defense game. This game was my first big project, I organized my code with methods and played around with moving images</p>

            <p>Towards the end of junior year I had an idea to create a 4 player chess game after playing real 4 player chess with some friends. While making this game I took advice from my CS teacher and organized my code even more with classes and methods. I also used moving images for the pieces. I even make three of the players play as computer and they were able to make decently educated decisions(and <strong>almost</strong> beat me sometimes).</p>

            <p>Working long hours doing boring tasks gives you time to think. One day at work my buddy and I developed an idea to write a program that would trade real stocks for us on the US stock market. After lots of time and versions and learning and youtube, a semi-functional stocks bot has come to fruition. This was cool because I was able to teach myself a new language, I learned a lot about the stock market, and probably coolest of all I dove deep in the world of APIs.</p>

            <p>This website! This is my very first website. This website used HTML and CSS. I learned the skills to make this website from youtube(isn't that amazing!)</p>
